        <h1>Technical Outline for Azure Resource Name Generation Web App</h1>
        <div class="overview">
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>This web application was created to automate the generation of names for Azure resources following specific naming conventions. It was developed using Full Stack Django for the backend and a combination of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript for the frontend</p>
        </div>

        <div class="requirements">
            <h2>Requirements</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Generate names based on a specific convention with constant and variable selection options.</li>
                <li>Automate fetching and updating of resource type acronyms from Microsoft.</li>
                <li>Ensure compatibility with Azure naming conventions and allow for bulk name generation.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="development">
            <h2>Development Steps</h2>
            <h3>Step 1: Planning and Resource Gathering</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Learning Phase:</b> Undertook a Full Stack Django course on Udemy to gain foundational knowledge in web development.</li>
                <li><b>Requirement Analysis:</b>  Listed the requirements for the website, focusing on the name generation logic and selection options.</li>
                <li><b>UI Design:</b> Decided on a drop-down menu interface for user selections to ensure ease of use and consistency.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="backend">
            <ul>
                <li><b>Backend Technology:</b>Chose Python with Django framework for its simplicity and powerfli libraries.</li>
                <li><b>Web Scraping:</b> Implemented a web scraper using Python to fetch and update the list of resource type acronyms from Microsoft daily.
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Data Storage:</b> Stored the scraped data in a CSV file, which is then used to popliate dropdown menus.</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                
                <li><b>Database Management:</b>  Used CSV files for data storage, avoiding traditional databases.</li>
                <li><b>Server-Side Logic</b> Developed views and logic to handle user requests and generate names based on selected options.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <div class="frontend">
            <ul>

        <div class="conclusion">
            <h2>Project Conclusion</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Functionality: </b> Successfully generated names but lacked full automation due to the need for unique human-entered names.</li>
                <li><b>Deployment:</b>Ran the application in a Docker container for testing but did not deploy it on Azure Web Apps due to limited practical use.</li>
                <li><b>Learning Outcomes:</b>Gained substantial knowledge and experience in web development, both frontend and backend, despite the project's limitations.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
